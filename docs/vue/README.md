# Motivation  

I have been using the Vue in the past three years. The overall experience was very delightful. 
One of the thing I like most is the documentation of Vue. It solves most of my question during the work.
But, I still found that my colleagues and me have some questions about how should we properly use certain things like 
"watch vs computed property".  

To be able to answer those questions, I started to reading the source code of Vue in the hope of having a better understanding on Vue.  

This is also largely inspired by [HcySunYang's job](http://caibaojian.com/vue-design/art/2vue-constructor.html). 
I truly benefit from reading the older version of source code analysis. 
It explains the idea behind the Vue and it almost do it line by line. Unfortunately, it only has chinese
version. For this reason, I think if there is an English version, more people could benefit from it.  


# Disclaimer
English is NOT my native language. Even though I read a lot of English articles every day. My writing is still poor.
I accept all the blaming on that. Feel free to submit a PR for correcting those errors.

This site isn't a simple translation from the abovve site. All the content is based on my understanding to the source code of Vue and
other poeple's work.  

My understanding is not necessarily correct. If you don't agree, Don't be hesitate. Submit a PR! I couldn't be happier
to learn from you.

Enjoy Reading.
